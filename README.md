# Practical JavaScript
Practical JavaScript Course from Watch and Code by Gordon Zhu

## Introduction

### What is Practical Javascript?

### The voice in your ear

### Is this course right for you?

### Everything is a todo list

### What you'll build

### The development process

### Approach - three stages

1. Introduction to the mechanics of programming

2. Read code so you can make sense of existing programs. This is the most important part.  

3. Learn through contributing to existing software projects. Role changes from consumer (someone that just reads code) to a producer (someone that writes code). All good programmers know that you'll spend much more time reading than writing code.
